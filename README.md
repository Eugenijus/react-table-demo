##Task:

- [ ] Use any public API or make own to load JSON with 5000+ records
- [x] Use vanilla js or any framework you like to implement data representation table (at least 3 columns)
- [x] Click on any column header it should sort the table by particular column, next click should reverse order.
- [ ] Add pagination. Leave the possibility to see all records at once.
- [ ] Output last clicked table cell data somewhere on the screen outside table. Change color of last clicked row.
- [ ] Have a strong concern about performance
- [x] Commit source to a public repository (GitHub) and send the link
- [ ]  Would be nice to have a live demo online
